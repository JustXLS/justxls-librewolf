## Packaging Workflow

The upstream branch contains a mirror of the [Gentoo mozilla overlay](https://gitweb.gentoo.org/proj/mozilla.git/) we want to re-use as much as possible from Gentoo (the mozilla eclasses) and make as litttle changes as possible. This should make it easier to update in the future. The upstream branch should be periodically updated with any necessary changes merged into master.
